# Partner Items

Realizing how important this feature is going to be I decided to make a dedicated ReadME for it so I can emphasize a few things here

## Goals
- The ultimate goal of partner items is to add a "flare" and real strategy to the gamemode, rather than making the entire gamemode revolve around partner items and make them simply a "spam this"-meta feature
- A number that I've settle myself with is around 10 total partner items (15 if we want to stretch it)
- Partner items will be split up mainly into 2 groups, the trapping and combat. Every map, the partner items will be randomized by these two types. Combat items like Combos, Focus Modes, Beserk's etc. will be primarily used for road fights and ganks while trapping partner items are obviously used for trapping, running into bases, escaping traps, and baiting into bases. The idea is that if the server rotates the partner items and on certain maps has let's say more combat items than trapping items (and vice versa), the entire dynamic of the HCF server will change map to map (i.e Map 22 will literally be all roadfights, Map 23 will be mostly trapping, Map 24 will be a balance, etc.). This ultimately will create a more dynamic HCF server experience (rather than the monotonous, kit-map like experience certain servers offer), requiring players to actually use a quarter of a fucking brain cell and not use the same 5 out of 30 partner items every single map.
- Essentially, create a partner item system that makes it so that almost every partner item can be used efficiently during the entire course of the map, not just the same 5 that people will spam

## Partner Items
- As said before, the goal will be to rotate 10 or 15 items in rotation each map, obviously certain partner items are gonna have an almost "permamnent" spot during the map (no one's playing HCF without their go to Combos or Focuses). Below are a list of partner items that will be in this "pool" of items to choose from:
     - Arc Stars
     - Combo Ability
     - Focus Mode
     - Portable Bard/Mage
     - Full Invis
     - Mortal Totem
     - Time Warps
     - Exotic Bone
     - Beacon
     - Haelstrom
     - Sigil
     - Angel Boots
     - Effect/Pot/Pearl Disabler
     - Ultimate Ability
     - Beskerk Ability
     - Vampire Ability
     - Ninja Ability
- Obviously, more items will be added to this list as the community decides on more
- Also, these partner items are the core partner items of HCF that of course need to be added but there will also be a mix of ORIGINAL partner items that are not mere skids off Java partner items (e.g Sigil, Angel Boots, Pearl Disabler, etc.)
