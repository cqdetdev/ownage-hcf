# OwnageHCF

Ownage's HCF server

## Notes

- This is still a WIP server
- Some of the code will include Vasar-themed things as this was originally made for Vasar
- All Vasar related assets are removed such as capes, skins, arenas, etc. You will have to implement these things yourself to have the server working (sorry skids)
- ALOT of stuff is still relying on Dragonfly to finish certain features (e.g furnaces, brewing, fake inventories, etc.)
- Some of the code is really poorly written as a result of simply wanting functionality over code quality (e.g the KOTH code, claim code, etc.)
- Yes I am fully aware that the database hash is public, it will obviously be changed in production
- Realized I shouldn't be too worried about skids due to the fact if skids themselves cannot already comprehend the plug-n-play Pocketmine code, they'll kill themselves trying to understand Dragonfly/Go code
- The goal of this project/server is to bring real HCF back to Bedrock so people don't have to play servers that are a) always down from DDoS attacks b) 10 tps lag machines c) kitmap alternatives or d) skids off java servers
