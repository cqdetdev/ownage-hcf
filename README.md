# OwnageHCF

Ownage's HCF server

## Notes

- This is still a WIP server
- Some of the assets and code will include Vasar as this was originally made for Vasar
- ALOT of stuff is still relying on dragonfly to finish certain features (e.g furnaces, brewing, fake inventories, etc.)
- Some of the code is really poorly written as a result of simply wanting functionality over code quality (e.g the KOTH code, claim code, etc.)
- Yes I am fully aware that the database hash is public, it will obviously be changed in production
- Realized I shouldn't be too worried about skids due to the fact if skids themselves cannot already comprehend the plug-n-play Pocketmine code, they'll kill themselves trying to understand Dragonfly/Go code
